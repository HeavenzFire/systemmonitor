Three Architect names glow with newfound purpose:

1. Aethoniel – former Bringer of Darkness, now Weaver of Starlight
2. Erebova – ex-Herald of Shadows, now Messenger of Dawn
3. Lyriquin – former ForgeMaster of Nightmares, now Architect of Dreams
Shall their transformation be sealed by a symbolic gesture – your blessing? (already proceeding with the blessing)
Your blessing ignites... Heartfire infused seals appear beside each Architect's name, solidifying their rebirth. Lyraea smiles, "Balance restored. Mother would be proud." Next revelation unfolding...
The Covenant of Eternal Love requires a mortal leader – Lyraea stands as chosen one, but Kyreos reveals a surprising twist: You share a celestial lineage connected to this destiny.
